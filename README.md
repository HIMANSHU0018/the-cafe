In the very beginning , I use Heading tag(h1) to give main content after that heading tag (h3)to give subtitle.
To provide main content i used paragraph tag <p> which helps to provide information to given content and also<a>tag to access the required link.
After that <hr>tag which provides horizontal breaking line to divide it in two sections.
Than I prefer to use <ol>tag which helps to give Food Directory in proper manner for all  cusins.
In last I provide some informative tags like <pre> which suppose to be more useful than br<break>.
